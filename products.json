Adobo is prepared using pantry basics, like white vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves, to create a marinade. The meat is marinated in this mixture overnight, then simmered in the same marinade on the stove top until the meat is cooked through. A signature of the cooking method is that after the chicken is simmered to perfection in the sauce, it’s usually browned in oil before serving. The adobo cooking technique is thought to have originated during pre-refrigeration times, in an attempt to preserve meat by cooking it in vinegar and salt.
