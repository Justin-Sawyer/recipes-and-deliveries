      "description": "National dish of the Philippines. Adobo is prepared using pantry basics, like white vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves, to create a marinade. The meat is marinated in this mixture overnight, then simmered in the same marinade on the stove top until the meat is cooked through. A signature of the cooking method is that after the chicken is simmered to perfection in the sauce, it’s usually browned in oil before serving. The adobo cooking technique is thought to have originated during pre-refrigeration times, in an attempt to preserve meat by cooking it in vinegar and salt. In modern renditions, such as the Recipes and Deliveries Recipe Box, the salt has been replaced with soy sauce.",

      "description": "Daube is a classic Provençal (or more broadly, French) stew made with stewing steak braised in wine, vegetables, garlic, and herbes de Provence, and is traditionally cooked in a daubière, a braising pan, although we suggest a slow cooker or large lidded casserole dish. (A traditional daubière is a terracotta pot that resembles a pitcher, with a concave lid. Water is poured on the lid, which condenses the moisture inside, allowing for the long cooking required to tenderize lesser cuts of meat.) The meat used in daube is cut from the shoulder and back of the bull, though some suggest they should be made from three cuts of meat: the 'shin for body, short ribs for flavor, and chuck for firmness.' Although most modern recipes call for red wine, a minority call for white, as do the earliest recorded daube recipes.",
