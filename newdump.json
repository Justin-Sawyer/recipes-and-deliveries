Leading the roster of Filipino delicacies are the lechon (roasted whole pig or chicken), sinigang (chicken, pork or beef soup usually prepared with tamarind and other ingredients), dinuguan (pork blood stew) and adobo (e.g. pork or chicken slow-cooked in vinegar, soy sauce, bay leaf, and garlic) Among these delectable meals, of course, adobo best fits the title, “The National Meal” along with the bamboo, mango, milkfish and carabao as other iconic symbols of the country.\r\n\r\nThe fact that adobo is well-loved by Filipinos, regardless of their social standing, home, province or region can not be denied. From the northernmost stretch of islands of Batanes to the vinta-dependent islets of Tawi-Tawi, adobo is a staple cuisine along with other regional favorites like the papaitan for the Ilocanos, pinikpikan for the Ifugaos and the Bicol Express for the Bicolanos. The dish is hugely popular among our native and indigent brothers as well as it is a must-eat among average and rich Filipinos alike. Different versions of the dish are usually the most-ordered meals on the menu of Filipino carinderias and restaurants; thus, signifying the nation’s penchant for adobo. The inviting smell of adobo lingers on our dining rooms every time we have our local gatherings or salu-salo. Even Filipino immigrants and overseas workers constantly crave for adobo abroad. Satiating their guilty pleasure, of course, only entails a session in the kitchen or a phone patch from home asking their loved ones to cook the most delicious adobo once they’ve reached Philippine shores again.\r\n\r\nAside from the fact that adobo is well-loved by Filipinos, the dish also makes use of many of our local ingredients giving adobo the distinct Filipino flavor. We can give credit to the pure cane vinegar for the adobo’s rich sour taste and to the locally-produced soy sauce for its savory and salty feel. Sitaw or kangkong can also be added for healthier alternative. For spicier versions of adobo, adding siling labuyo and recado enhances the over-all zest of the meal.\r\n\r\nNo other Filipino dish can also compete with adobo in terms of versatility and variety. Mixing vinegar, soy sauce and spices with either chicken, pork, fish, kangkong, sitaw or even crickets would yield to different varieties of the famous Filipino dish. Adobo sa gata, adobong matamis, adobong tuyo, adobong masabaw, adobo sulipan, adobo sa pinya, adobo sa kalamansi are only a few of the many ways to cook adobo. Adobo can also fill our pandesals, siopao, and puto, be made into adobo flakes, be poured evenly into our pizzas, and be mixed with spaghetti. And if those are not enough, local food companies have recently come up with adobo sauce and adobo spread.\r\n\r\nAdobo has the support of the Filipino people, the flavor, and the versatility to be an icon of the country. The meal offers an exciting feast for the senses and is indeed most deserving of the hallmark, “The National Meal”.\r\n\r\n(Source: https://www.freeonlineresearchpapers.com/adobo-national-meal-philippines-culinary/)", "date": "2021-07-25T12:38:15.089Z", "date_posted": "2021-07-25T14:21:49Z", "date_edited": "2021-07-27T10:47:51.231Z", "category": [1, 3, 11, 12], "tag": [5, 3, 4]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 3, "fields": {"author": 5, "title": "How To Make The Perfect Salade Niçoise", "tagline": "Far from it being a recipe set in stone, even the choice of fish in a salade niçoise is up for debate. How do you make yours?", "image": "salade-nicoise_OnXs0KC.jpg", "image_credit": "Recipes and Deliveries", "content": "'What crimes have been committed in the name of this pure and fresh salad whose base is made of tomatoes, which contains only raw vegetables, with the exception of hard-boiled eggs, which is prepared without vinegar, by salting three the tomatoes and sprinkling them with a drizzle of oil!\r\n\r\n'Often, even the locals mix anchovy and tuna in the same salad; this is never done in the tradition, since tuna, at the time very expensive, was only used on important occasions; most of the time, anchovy replaced it because it was more affordable.\r\n\r\n'I beg all those who really want to ensure the reputation of the cuisine of this country never to incorporate in a Niçoise salad even the smallest boiled vegetable or the smallest potato.'\r\n\r\nSo said Jaques Médecin, and he should know, being the former Mayor of Nice!\r\n\r\nHaving spent about two-thirds of my life to date avoiding salade niçoise I'm taking a deep breath before wading into this subject. It is as contentious as the exact rules of pétanque or the optimal ratio of pastis to water at l'heure de l'apéro, and I feel scantily qualified.\r\n\r\nIn my defence, when I actually spent some time in Nice and its environs I realised my prejudice was entirely based on the British version of the dish, which regards tinned tuna (my bête noir) as a mandatory ingredient. In the cafes of the Alpes Maritime, however, the constituent parts are far more of a lottery – and tuna, in my happy experience, is definitely less popular than the diminutive anchovy. As Nigel Slater observes, 'whenever I say 'hold the tuna' I am invariably told that I wasn't going to get any anyway'.)\r\n\r\nIn Britain, then, as well as the objectionably odoriferous fish, a salade niçoise will always, always contain hard-boiled eggs, potatoes and French beans – and perhaps a couple of rubbery black olives. These are exactly the kind of ingredients that provoked the considerable ire of Nice's former mayor, Jacques Médecin, who managed to take time out from sympathising with the Front National to write a Niçoise cookbook, in part, he says, inspired by the horrific experience, 'all around the world' of seeing 'the remains of other people's meals being served under the name salade niçoise'.\r\n\r\n'Whatever you do,' Médecin begs, 'if you want to be a worthy exponent of Niçoise cookery, never, never, I beg you, include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable.' And, just because the man was convicted of embezzlement and accused of womanising and racism doesn't mean he couldn't make a decent salad. Just ask any chef.\r\n\r\nThe matter of fish\r\nAs it's the issue that looms largest in my mind, first I'm going to tackle the issue of fish. Médecin says that traditionally anchovies are a more common addition than expensive tuna, which was saved for special occasions, and that the two would never be used together (although he admits sadly that 'nowadays even the Niçois often combine anchovies with tuna').\r\n\r\nI'm surprised to find that the first few recipes I look at eschew the tuna altogether – Rowley Leigh, Nigel Slater and Simon Hopkinson all prefer it without – but finally, I find an exponent in good old Delia Smith, who calls the niçoise 'one of the best combinations of salad ingredients ever invented'. And, although I also expect to find lots of recipes calling for seared fresh tuna, as served in what Delia describes as many a 'slick restaurant', I actually have to hunt around a bit for one of them too, finally finding one in an old Gary Rhodes book. Perhaps the idea has gone the same way as sun-dried tomatoes and balsamic reductions.\r\n\r\nIn order to give the fish a fair trial, I shell out for the priciest tinned tuna I can find, and enlist a tasting panel of less biased niçoise fans. I try a bit straight from the can, and it's actually not bad, even when sniffed at close quarters, but in the salad I'm not convinced. It's nice enough, but it has quite a mild flavour which doesn't have a hope against the strident saltiness of the anchovies. Indeed, the majority of my tasters agree it's 'a bit pointless' in this context – so that's tuna out. If you do want to use it, I'd obey M Médecin and leave out the anchovies.\r\n\r\nGary serves his chargrilled tuna with a sort of niçoise salsa. It makes, I must admit, a very fine supper, but it's not a salade niçoise – and chopping up such an expensive piece of fish and tossing it together with the salad would seem like a terrible waste. Anchovies it is, then.\r\n\r\nFruit and vegetables\r\nGary and Delia Smith are the only recipes that use potatoes – waxy little new ones, as in the finest potato salads. I'm unsurprised to find that they're utterly delicious with the anchovies, capers and eggs, but I'm not convinced by them with the tomatoes and cucumber – indeed, Médecin's diatribe has given me pause for thought.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Provençales aren't averse to the odd spud (for example, brandade), you'd be hard-pressed to call them a typically Mediterranean ingredient, and I think they clash with the sunshine flavours of the rest of the salad. A French website I find notes that, all too often, 'salade niçoise' is simply used as another name for a mixed salad – and however nice potatoes are in a salad, they quite possibly have no place in this particular one. Reluctantly, I ditch the spuds.\r\n\r\nOn to French beans, again as used by Delia and Gary, and which also have their fans in Nigel Slater and Simon Hopkinson. Rowley Leigh is strongly against them, and David Lebovitz, who proclaims himself a disciple of Médecin on this point, goes for raw broad beans instead. The tasting panel is divided: two of our number come out very strongly in favour of the French beans, while the rest of us like the broad variety.\r\n\r\nWhat is certain is that both add body to the salad, tomatoes and cucumbers being undeniably rather watery entities, so I'm going to sit on the fence on this one and recommend broad beans for as long as you can get the fresh kind. If you really want to make a salade niçoise at any other time of the year (which I wouldn't recommend, with ripe tomatoes so hard to get hold of in this country at the best of times) go for French beans instead.\r\n\r\nLebovitz uses torn lettuce in his salad, as does Nigel Slater, while Delia says she now likes 'to abandon [it] in favour of a few rocket leaves'. The panel unanimously prefers the salads, like Rowley Leigh's, which contain no leaves whatsoever – although I serve the Lebovitz salad immediately one taster describes it as 'a little bit sad' in comparison with the robust crunchiness of its competitors. Even the peppery rocket seems a bit of an afterthought.\r\n\r\nCucumber is pretty much a constant, apart from in a version by Jean-Noël Escudier in his La Veritable Cuisine Provencale et Niçoise, quoted by Elizabeth David in French Provincial Cooking, which is a very simple affair of tomatoes strewn with anchovies, chopped green pepper and black olives. I like the crunch it adds – and the simple refreshment it provides in a dish which, for maximum enjoyment, should be saved for very hot days. Deseeding it is essential however, so it doesn't make the salad too watery, and peeling it in stripes, as Rowley Leigh suggests, is a very easy way to make it look pretty too.\r\n\r\nAs Escudier's recipe suggests, tomatoes should be a major part of every niçoise – and they have to be really ripe. I'm tempted to regard skinning them, as Rowley and Delia suggest, as an unnecessary cheffy faff for such a rustic salad, until I realise that without their skins they absorb even more of the dressing. It only takes a minute in any case. Deseeding them is another must, for the same reason as the cucumber.\r\n\r\nGary and Rowley Leigh use spring onions, Delia shallots, and David Lebovitz suggests spring onions or thinly sliced red onion. The raw shallots are too aggressive, but I quite like the red onion – the flavour of the spring onion, however, wins on freshness grounds.\r\n\r\nMédecin uses green pepper, as does Escudier, which suggests to me it's the traditional choice. Gary opts for yellow, presumably for the flash of colour it delivers, but I prefer the sweetness of Rowley Leigh's red pepper with the saltiness of the anchovies and olives. Rowley also uses radishes, which seem too northern. Médecin suggests small globe artichokes, sliced and added raw, which I'm unable to find – Nigel's marinated artichoke hearts seem like a clear contravention of the cooked vegetable rule.\r\n\r\nThe egg factor\r\nSadly missed in the Escudier recipe, eggs should be hard boiled, as Rowley Leigh suggests. Hot things in cold salads are not particularly nice, and cold soft-boiled eggs are divisive. One of my tasters sagely observes that they maintain their integrity better cut into wedges, rather than sliced.\r\n\r\nThe dressing\r\nMédecin, and thus David Lebovitz, dresses his salad with fruity olive oil (local of course). Rowley Leigh and Escudier go for a simple drizzle of red wine vinegar and olive oil, Delia makes a garlicky, mustardy vinaigrette, and Gary mixes finely chopped eggs with garlic and herbs and olive oil. Delia's dressing is too dominant: you don't need Dijon mustard if you have Provencale olives and anchovies (although Delia actually uses English mustard powder). A hint of vinegar is nice though – Lebovitz's salad tastes a bit too oily without it.\r\n\r\nGarlic, however, is an absolute must – and adding it to the dressing is a more reliable way of doing things than the classic rubbing of the salad bowl trick. I'm also borrowing an idea from Gary Rhodes' salsa niçoise and finely chopping a few anchovies in addition to the slivers of fish used as a topping; this way you get a punch of gloriously salty anchovies in every bite, which is definitely a good thing as far as I'm concerned. Capers are, I think, optional – Médecin doesn't use them, but they do work well with the other Provencale goodies in the dish.\r\n\r\nA classic fines herbes is a popular addition to salade niçoise – Delia suggests chives and chervil and tarragon, among others, a combination also favoured by Escoffier, and she also adds chopped parsley but I finally decide on the basil preferred by Leigh and Médecin – it puts the final, Mediterranean stamp on the dish.\r\n\r\n(Source: The Guardian and justins)", "date": "2021-07-29T17:59:52.821Z", "date_posted": "2021-07-29T17:59:52Z", "date_edited": "2021-08-06T15:50:12.377Z", "category": [2, 8, 9, 11], "tag": [10, 2, 1]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 4, "fields": {"author": 5, "title": "Chorba", "tagline": "Chorba or shorba, refers to several kinds of soup or stew found in national cuisines across the world.", "image": "chorba_gAjnV5g.jpg", "image_credit": "Recipes and Deliveries", "content": "Chorba (or shorba) refers to several kinds of soup or stew found in national cuisines across the Balkans, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.

The two main subspecies of rice – indica (prevalent in tropical regions) and japonica (prevalent in the subtropical and temperate regions of East Asia) – are not believed to have been derived from independent domestication events. Another cultivated species, O. glaberrima, was domesticated much later in West Africa.\r\n\r\nRecent genetic evidence show that all forms of Asian rice, both indica and japonica, come from a single domestication event that occurred 8,200–13,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of China.\r\n\r\nIn China, extensive archeological evidence points to the middle Yangtze and upper Huai rivers as the two earliest places of O. sativa cultivation in the country. Rice and farming implements dating back at least 8,000 years have been found. Cultivation spread down these rivers over the following 2,000 years. \r\n\r\nPuddling the soil – turning it to mud to break it down and prevent too much water percolating away – and transplanting seedlings were likely refined in China. Both operations became integral parts of rice farming and remain widely practiced to this day. With the development of puddling and transplanting, rice became truly domesticated. \r\n\r\nMovement to western India and south to Sri Lanka was also accomplished very early. Rice was a major crop in Sri Lanka as early as 1000 B.C. The crop may well have been introduced to Greece and the neighboring areas of the Mediterranean by returning members of Alexander the Great’s expedition to India around 344-324 B.C. From a center in Greece and Sicily, rice spread gradually throughout southern Europe and to a few locations in northern Africa. \r\n\r\nAs a result of Europe’s great Age of Exploration, new lands to the west became available for exploitation. Rice cultivation was introduced to the New World by early European settlers. The Portuguese carried it to Brazil and the Spanish introduced its cultivation to several locations in Central and South America. The first record for North America dates from 1685, when the crop was produced on the coastal lowlands and islands of what is now South Carolina. It is thought that slaves from West Africa who were transported to the Carolinas in the mid-18th century introduced the complex agricultural technology needed to grow rice. Their labor then insured a flourishing rice industry. By the 20th century, rice was produced in California’s Sacramento Valley. The introduction into California corresponded almost exactly with the timing of the first successful crop in Australia’s New South Wales. \r\n\r\nRegional development of rice cultivation:\r\nAsia\r\nBased on archeological evidence, rice was believed to have first been domesticated in the region of the Yangtze River valley in China. Morphological studies of rice phytoliths from the Diaotonghuan archaeological site clearly show the transition from the collection of wild rice to the cultivation of domesticated rice. The large number of wild rice phytoliths at the Diaotonghuan level dating from 12,000–11,000 BP indicates that wild rice collection was part of the local means of subsistence. Changes in the morphology of Diaotonghuan phytoliths dating from 10,000–8,000 BP show that rice had by this time been domesticated.[28] Soon afterwards the two major varieties of indica and japonica rice were being grown in Central China. In the late 3rd millennium BC, there was a rapid expansion of rice cultivation into mainland Southeast Asia and westwards across India and Nepal.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Korean archaeologists claimed to have discovered the world's oldest domesticated rice. Their 15,000 year old age challenges the accepted view that rice cultivation originated in China about 12,000 years ago. These findings were received by academia with strong skepticism, and the results and their publicizing has been cited as being driven by a combination of nationalist and regional interests.In 2011, a combined effort by the Stanford University, New York University, Washington University in St. Louis, and Purdue University has provided the strongest evidence yet that there is only one single origin of domesticated rice, in the Yangtze Valley of China.\r\n\r\nThe earliest remains of the grain in the Indian subcontinent have been found in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and date from 7000–6000 BC though the earliest widely accepted date for cultivated rice is placed at around 3000–2500 BC with findings in regions belonging to the Indus Valley Civilization. Perennial wild rices still grow in Assam and Nepal. It seems to have appeared around 1400 BC in southern India after its domestication in the northern plains. It then spread to all the fertile alluvial plains watered by rivers. Cultivation and cooking methods are thought to have spread to the west rapidly and by medieval times, southern Europe saw the introduction of rice as a hearty grain.\r\n\r\nO. sativa was recovered from a grave at Susa in Iran (dated to the 1st century AD) at one end of the ancient world, another domestication of rice in South Asia.\r\n\r\nToday, the majority of all rice produced comes from China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Philippines, and Japan. Asian farmers still account for 92% of the world's total rice production.\r\n\r\nAfrica\r\nAfrican rice has been cultivated for 3500 years. Between 1500 and 800 BC, Oryza glaberrima propagated from its original centre, the Niger River delta, and extended to Senegal. However, it never developed far from its original region. Its cultivation even declined in favour of the Asian species, which was introduced to East Africa early in the common era and spread westward. African rice helped Africa conquer its famine of 1203.\r\n\r\nRest of the world\r\nMiddle East\r\nRice was grown in some areas of southern Iraq. With the rise of Islam it moved north to Nisibin, the southern shores of the Caspian Sea and then beyond the Muslim world into the valley of Volga. In Egypt, rice is mainly grown in the Nile Delta. In Palestine, rice came to be grown in the Jordan Valley. Rice is also grown in Yemen.\r\n\r\nEurope\r\nThe Moors brought Asiatic rice to the Iberian Peninsula in the 10th century. Records indicate it was grown in Valencia and Majorca. In Majorca, rice cultivation seems to have stopped after the Christian conquest, although historians are not certain.\r\n\r\nMuslims also brought rice to Sicily, where it was an important crop long before it is noted in the plain of Pisa (1468) or in the Lombard plain (1475), where its cultivation was promoted by Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, and demonstrated in his model farms.\r\n\r\nAfter the 15th century, rice spread throughout Italy and then France, later propagating to all the continents during the age of European exploration.The Ottomans introduced rice to the Balkans.\r\n\r\nCaribbean and Latin America\r\nRice is not native to the Americas but was introduced to Latin America and the Caribbean by European colonizers at an early date with Spanish colonizers introducing Asian rice to Mexico in the 1520s at Veracruz and the Portuguese and their African slaves introducing it at about the same time to Colonial Brazil. Recent scholarship suggests that enslaved Africans played an active role in the establishment of rice in the New World and that African rice was an important crop from an early period. Varieties of rice and bean dishes that were a staple dish along the peoples of West Africa remained a staple among their descendants subjected to slavery in the Spanish New World colonies, Brazil and elsewhere in the Americas.\r\n\r\nThe Native Americans of what is now the Eastern United States may have practiced extensive agriculture with forms of wild rice. (References to wild rice in the Americas are to the unrelated Zizania palustris.)\r\n\r\nUnited States\r\nIn the United States, colonial South Carolina and Georgia grew and amassed great wealth from the Slavery labor obtained from the Senegambia area of West Africa and from coastal Sierra Leone. At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of Africa brought the highest prices, in recognition of their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice plantations around Georgetown, Charleston, and Savannah. From the enslaved Africans, plantation owners learned how to dyke the marshes and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was milled by hand with wooden paddles, then winnowed in sweetgrass baskets (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the rice mill increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by millwright Jonathan Lucas was another step forward. Rice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the American Civil War, and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the only remaining rice plantation in South Carolina that still has the original winnowing barn and rice mill from the mid-19th century at the historic Mansfield Plantation in Georgetown, South Carolina. The predominant strain of rice in the Carolinas was from Africa and was known as \"Carolina Gold.\" The cultivar has been preserved and there are current attempts to reintroduce it as a commercially grown crop.\r\n\r\nIn the southern United States, rice has been grown in southern Arkansas, Louisiana, and east Texas since the mid-19th century. Many Cajun farmers grew rice in wet marshes and low lying prairies where they could also farm crawfish when the fields were flooded. In recent years rice production has risen in North America, especially in the Mississippi River Delta areas in the states of Arkansas and Mississippi.\r\n\r\nRice cultivation began in California during the California Gold Rush, when an estimated 40,000 Chinese laborers immigrated to the state and grew small amounts of the grain for their own consumption. However, commercial production began only in 1912 in the town of Richvale in Butte County. By 2006, California produced the second largest rice crop in the United States, after Arkansas, with production concentrated in six counties north of Sacramento. Unlike the Mississippi Delta region, California's production is dominated by short- and medium-grain japonica varieties, including cultivars developed for the local climate such as Calrose, which makes up as much as 85% of the state's crop.\r\n\r\nMore than 100 varieties of rice are commercially produced primarily in six states (Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and California) in the U.S. According to estimates for the 2006 crop year, rice production in the U.S. is valued at $1.88 billion, approximately half of which is expected to be exported. The U.S. provides about 12% of world rice trade. The majority of domestic utilization of U.S. rice is direct food use (58%), while 16% is used in each of processed foods and beer. The remaining 10% is found in pet food.\r\n\r\nAustralia\r\nRice was one of the earliest crops planted in Australia by British settlers, who had experience with rice plantations in the Americas and the subcontinent.\r\n\r\nAlthough attempts to grow rice in the well-watered north of Australia have been made for many years, they have consistently failed because of inherent iron and manganese toxicities in the soils and destruction by pests.\r\n\r\nIn the 1920s it was seen as a possible irrigation crop on soils within the Murray-Darling Basin that were too heavy for the cultivation of fruit and too infertile for wheat.\r\n\r\nBecause irrigation water, despite the extremely low runoff of temperate Australia, was (and remains) very cheap, the growing of rice was taken up by agricultural groups over the following decades. Californian varieties of rice were found suitable for the climate in the Riverina, and the first mill opened at Leeton in 1951.\r\n\r\nEven before this Australia's rice production greatly exceeded local needs, and rice exports to Japan have become a major source of foreign currency. Above-average rainfall from the 1950s to the middle 1990s encouraged the expansion of the Riverina rice industry, but its prodigious water use in a practically waterless region began to attract the attention of environmental scientists. These became severely concerned with declining flow in the Snowy River and the lower Murray River.\r\n\r\nAlthough rice growing in Australia is highly profitable due to the cheapness of land, several recent years of severe drought have led many to call for its elimination because of its effects on extremely fragile aquatic ecosystems. The Australian rice industry is somewhat opportunistic, with the area planted varying significantly from season to season depending on water allocations in the Murray and Murrumbidgee irrigation regions.\r\n\r\n(source: https://ricepedia.org/culture/history-of-rice-cultivation)", "date": "2021-08-11T09:56:11.707Z", "date_posted": "2021-08-11T09:56:11.653Z", "date_edited": "2021-08-11T09:56:11.707Z", "category": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], "tag": [142]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 78, "fields": {"author": 5, "title": "Why don't we eat more cauliflower?", "tagline": "How do you like your cauliflower?", "image": "cauliflower.jpg", "image_credit": "Photo by Arina Krasnikova from Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/photo/food-healthy-vegetables-texture-6316515/", "content": "If there’s one dish that reminds me of childhood home, it’s cauliflower cheese. My mum was a reluctant cook so cauliflower cheese became our staple diet – every day for high tea. We washed it down with weak tea and Women’s Institute cake. Actually, mum did a pretty good job: unlike the cooks at school who turned cauliflower into grey mush, she never overcooked it. And she lavished the magical tree-like florets with generous amounts of cheese-rich sauce.\r\n\r\nSo I’m sad to hear that we Brits no longer want to eat this wonderfully eccentric-looking vegetable. Sales have dropped around 35% over the past decade, and last year, nearly half of British households didn’t buy a single cauliflower. In short, if we don’t start buying this snowy brassica again, growers are now warning it could soon become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe reason I’m fighting to keep cauliflower on our tables - apart from bringing back tender childhood memories – is its sheer versatility. It’s crunchily delicious eaten raw in a salad with plenty of lemon, in fritters, or as a pretty crudité to dunk into delicious dips. It combines brilliantly with spices, green beans, cucumbers and courgettes to make a piccalilli, and is amazing in a curry. Cauli is nice roasted too. And few things pair better with fresh scallops than a silky smooth cauliflower purée.\r\n\r\nGoing back to cauliflower cheese, there are plenty of things you can do to pep it up. Add mustard and use a tasty British cheese such as a Lincolnshire Poacher, as in the cauli cheese that James Martin serves up with griddled pork chops and cabbage. Or sprinkle the top with breadcrumbs, mixed with a hard cheese like Parmesan, to form a crunchy crust. Or adorn your dish with a few crispy bacon rashers.\r\n\r\nThe awful weather has made life extra difficult for farmers cultivating cauliflower, devilish to grow at the best of times. But in its favour, it’s one of the few vegetables that can be grown in Britain all year round, and unlike veg such as tomatoes, doesn’t need greenhouses or polytunnels to flourish. By eating cauliflower rather than imported veg, we help British farmers and save food miles. Before the last struggling growers throw in the trowel, I reckon it’s time to give cauliflower another chance. Do you agree?\r\n\r\n(Source:  https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/food/2012/08/why-dont-we-eat-more-cauliflow.shtml)", "date": "2021-08-11T10:06:31.891Z", "date_posted": "2021-08-11T10:06:31.887Z", "date_edited": "2021-08-11T10:06:31.891Z", "category": [6, 7], "tag": [143]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 79, "fields": {"author": 5, "title": "Street food: has it lost its way?", "tagline": "Do you enjoy the buzz of the new food stalls and relish the innovative food they offer or do you prefer to go to a café or pub when you want a cheap meal?", "image": "street-food.jpg", "image_credit": "Photo by Adrian Dorobantu from Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/photo/cooked-food-2170312/", "content": "With the bank holiday to end all bank holidays coming up this weekend there’s a fair chance you’ll be out and about at a local food festival. There’s a big one coming up at London’s South Bank. But despite the perception that street food is cheap are we actually getting good value for money when we buy our lunch - or supper - off a stand?\r\n\r\nPop-ups and food stalls are all the rage and a great way for newcomers to break into the restaurant business but they’re not necessarily a low cost option. I recently went to a local one in my home town of Bristol and the prices for burgers were much the same as the West End of London. Without the facilities of a restaurant.\r\n\r\nUsually there are a couple of rickety tables you can nab if you’re lucky. Otherwise it’s a question of wandering around trying to balance your lunch, your bags and your drink without squirting ketchup or hot sauce down yourself. And that’s after having to queue for 10 minutes or so.\r\n\r\nQuite often the food isn’t that good which doesn’t matter when you’re a student and filling a hole after a late night drinking session at the pub but isn’t quite so satisfying when you’re a bit more discriminating. At the same fair there was a hot dog stall which had some great sausages but packed into some really dire soggy white rolls. The kind you’d have paid under a couple of quid for on an old-fashioned hot dog stand.\r\n\r\nMany of us have been to countries where street food is a way of life - in Thailand I can remember having amazing noodles round a tiny van on the back streets of Bangkok but they were dirt cheap - around 50p I seem to recall.\r\n\r\nAnd in Portland in Oregon where there are over 500 food carts I had a fantastic dish of chicken and rice for around £3.50. But as usual in the UK we seem to have jacked up the prices and lost the ethos of street food in the process.\r\n\r\nIt’s not surprising that restaurateurs feel a little resentful of the new street food scene and the pop-up restaurants and supper clubs that have grown up alongside them. They have to pay rent, rates and taxes, abide by employment laws and conform with draconian hygiene regulations and inspections yet many would argue they offer better service and food than a stall.\r\n\r\n(Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/food/2012/05/street-food-has-it-lost-its-wa.shtml)", "date": "2021-08-11T10:14:57.963Z", "date_posted": "2021-08-11T10:14:57.959Z", "date_edited": "2021-08-11T10:14:57.963Z", "category": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "tag": []}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 80, "fields": {"author": 5, "title": "The vegetarian in the family: how to satisfy everyone", "tagline": "Do you cater for a mixed household?

A recent survey of the vegetarian food market states that as many as 3.8 million people describe themselves as ‘mainly vegetarian’ – e.g., they eat fish – and 1.9m describe themselves as ‘strictly vegetarian’.  It’s likely that someone in your family may announce one day that they are no longer eating meat.\r\n\r\nIn the modern household there will be many different tastes and diet choices. I'm a meat-eater but (oh, am I going to say it?) some of my best friends are vegetarian. I can imagine the day when my kids push away their plates of spaghetti bolognese, and I want to be able to continue the tradition of a family meal without double the cooking.\r\n\r\nThe majority of us should probably reduce our meat intake anyway, for cost, environmental and health reasons. A veggie in the house is a great reason to explore meat-free dishes. But how does a home cook cope with satisfying everyone?\r\n\r\nMeet (not meat) in the middle\r\nAs a regular meat-eater, I know that I feel a little skittish and unsatisfied after a few days of veggie meals. This is probably less to do with the lack of abundant protein (we generally consume way more than we need), but I suspect it’s to do with texture.\r\n\r\nMeat-eaters miss both the chewiness and the savouriness that comes from a bit of meat. Chewing meat slows down the consumption of dinner (unless you’re consuming some pappy fast food burger that is specifically designed to be consumed faster than the brain can register it being eaten).\r\n\r\nWild rice, pearl barley or bulgar wheat might seem a bit seventies, but I find they do make a dish significantly chewier. Nuts add texture to pasta dishes or salads with salty, creamy cheeses – you don’t have to go so far as a making it into a loaf. It may sound ridiculously simple, but some chargrilled ciabatta, crisp and toasty, drizzled with fruity olive oil can add bite to some grilled vegetables or a summery tomato salad. \r\n\r\nThe combination of savouriness and sweetness in a piece of nicely cooked meat is also harder to recreate in vegetables. Not impossible, by any means.\r\n\r\nNigella Lawson in her wonderful book Feast describes halloumi as ‘vegetarian bacon’ – the salty savouriness and chewiness of this squeaky cheese is a great stand-in.  Smoked foods – mozzarella, tofu, garlic – are also good when missing meaty flavours.\r\n\r\nMiso paste, mushrooms and tomatoes add umami – the savoury flavour found in soy sauce or Marmite - use liberally, balanced with plenty of fresh herbs so that dishes aren’t relentlessly brown.\r\n\r\nThere are recipes that are vegetarian and contain a range of textures, flavours and satisfying savouriness – as anyone who’s cooked from Yotam Ottolenghi’s books will know. But these recipes do need seeking out, and they are going to be more work than throwing a chop under the grill.  Still, I find every recipe gets easier and quicker with practice and adding a few sure favourites to your repertoire is a good start. Here are some personal faves:\r\n\r\nSome households will still require a meaty dinner regularly. Some vegetarian mothers I know accept the cooking of meat for the rest of the family (though they never feel completely confident about it). One friend keeps veggie portions in the freezer for these nights, or she hoovers up leftovers.\r\n\r\nI think there’s a trick to finding one meal that can suit everyone. Instead of starting to plan your meal around the meat, plan it around the vegetarian dish and treat the meat as a side dish.\r\n\r\nMake a bunch of beef meatballs and keep them in the freezer, so that a veggie tomato sauce for pasta can get a beefy boost when needed. Also, lamb meatballs are great to throw into a chickpea and vegetable tagine over some couscous, or can be part of a tapas or mezze dinner. Vegetarian curries feel very natural and are incredibly versatile. A little tandoori chicken on the side, and everyone wins.\r\n\r\nWe naturally base dinners around leftovers. Pea soup can be topped (or not) with shreds of ham, a peanutty Asian noodle salad has the option of shredded roast chicken. Put the effort into big Yorkshire pudding (with vegetable oil in place of dripping) and vegetarian onion gravy, and a bit of leftover roast beef is there for those that need it. (Maybe veggie sausages, too.)\r\n\r\nOn roast or casserole days, the amenable vegetarian probably still needs something tucked away to enjoy separately. But hopefully, these times can be infrequent enough to ensure that the family meal is a shared one.\r\n\r\n(Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/food/2012/05/mostlyvegetarianmealideas.shtml)", "date": "2021-08-11T10:20:40.166Z", "date_posted": "2021-08-11T10:20:40.162Z", "date_edited": "2021-08-11T10:20:40.166Z", "category": [6, 7, 9], "tag": []}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 81, "fields": {"author": 5, "title": "From one pie lover to another...", "tagline": "Do you have any pie making tips?

Or perhaps it’s the hidden mystery of the flavour concealed within that captures the imagination and makes a pie hard to resist.\r\n\r\nSub-standard pies became for many years “the symbol of stodgy service station fare”, says BBC Radio 4’s Food Programme. \"The life of pie\" examines how chefs and cooks alike are rediscovering the joys of a lovingly made pastry containing top quality ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe humble pie now comes in all shapes, flavours and forms, some far superior to the meat pies (minced or diced beef with gravy, onions or cheese) of my childhood in New Zealand. They are celebrated as part of “Kiwiana” culture, and are also treated to iconic status in Australian cuisine. (I say humble, but New Zealanders are incredibly proud of their pies – as evidenced by over 4,400 entries to the annual NZ Supreme Pie Awards.)\r\n\r\nThe passion for pie was brought to New Zealand from its English settlers: “Our English housewife must be skilful in pastry, and know how and in what manner to bake all sorts of meat,” wrote Gervase Markham in the English Housewife in 1615. At this time the pie was even used as the centrepiece of great tables - occasionally containing (hilariously) live frogs or blackbirds.\r\n\r\nBut the British pie goes as far back as the Middle Ages, though one of the primary purposes of pastry was simply to contain and protect the meat, according to food writer Harold McGee. Inedible pastry cases used as cooking vessels were called ‘coffyns’. And from that grim beginning grew a love of pastry and what it could do.\r\n\r\nMcGee says the word pie developed in medieval English and was the equivalent of the French word pâté – a word used to describe both blends of meat and types of pastry (as in pâté sablée). \r\n\r\n“Pie meant a dish of any sort, meat, fish, vegetable or fruit, enclosed in pastry,” McGee says, and the word was not to do with dough, but rather the use of odds and ends. Quite appropriate as the word pie was borrowed from a bird that makes a comfortable nest from whatever’s to hand – the magpie.\r\n\r\nThrowing any old odds and ends is perhaps not the best way to make a pie, although some of the flavours I’ve tried over the years show surprising and unsurprising combinations can work – Thai green curry, tandoori chicken and chilli crab spring to mind.\r\n\r\nGetting the right thickness to your pastry and ensuring it cooks perfectly, are key to creating the perfect pie. The crucial tip for the best crust is to keep both filling and pastry cold prior to baking.\r\nThere are as many varieties of pastry as there are fillings – from rough puff to cream cheese to rich shortcrust, polenta and oat pastries. (This gluten-free pastry is great for savoury pies, too.)\r\n\r\nAs to fillings, I love a traditional chicken and leek and it’s on that’s much loved elsewhere too - this year the supreme winner of the British Pie Awards contained chicken, ham, mushroom and buttered leeks under suet pastry.\r\n\r\nWhile debate has raged for years over whether pasties are pies, I take a rather inclusive approach and say anything with pastry involved is of the same family. From the politically controversial Cornish pasty  in the south to the Scottish bridie – each has their own character that epitomises the versatility of the pie, and demonstrates its consistent appeal. In particular I love empanadas and veggie ricotta parcels.\r\n\r\nBut I have to say, in the sweet pie arena, the Americans always win; after all they use it as a benchmark of their culture in the phrase, \"As American as apple pie”. But they also top the pie charts with pumpkin pie, key lime pie, and the blowsy, billowing lemon meringue pie.\r\n\r\nNo one can resist a sweet piece of pie (not even Agent Cooper) – although perhaps not following a pie as a main course. I'm sure you know can imagine the result – an all-too real exemplification of that modern idiom: “Who ate all the pies?”\r\n\r\n(Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/food/2012/05/from-one-pie-lover-to-another.shtml)", "date": "2021-08-11T10:28:58.636Z", "date_posted": "2021-08-11T10:28:58.603Z", "date_edited": "2021-08-11T10:28:58.636Z", "category": [11, 12], "tag": [144]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 82, "fields": {"author": 5, "title": "Stuck on you: a bakers's guide to non-stick baking", "tagline": "How important is non-stick bakeware for you?

A fridge that always works, an oven that’s dependable (ok, the door is a bit iffy), and I aim to make sure the things I bake never, ever stick to the tins.\r\n\r\nWhen I work in bakeries we use all sorts of expensive tricks: lecithin aerosol sprays, plastic film for blind-baking pastry cases, silicone baking mats or endless sheets of silicone-coated non-stick paper.\r\n\r\nBut at home, these high-end options are often not worth the expense if you’re only baking occasionally. So gleaming there in the shops temptingly, typically with a celebrity chef endorsement, is non-stick bakeware, coated with chemicals that stop some mixtures sticking to it.\r\n\r\nThe history\r\nBut before these coatings were invented, cooks tackled this sticky problem using other techniques. I spoke with food historian Ivan Day, who has looked into the history in detail.\r\n\r\n“The Victorian chef Jules Gouffé is quite specific on how to prepare ornate baking tins,” said Ivan, “and insisted on using calves’ suet as the flavour was very neutral. Beef dripping wasn’t recommended for preparing tins for sweet cakes and pastry as it had a pronounced meatiness, though it might be mixed half-and-half with clarified butter.”\r\n\r\nTo use it, Gouffé recommends warming the tin first, spooning the melted suet in and swirling it around to coat the inside evenly before placing it on an angle to drain and allow any steam to escape. This last step is important, says Ivan, as moisture in this fat “lining” could cause the cake to stick.\r\n\r\nThen a cupful of caster sugar would be rolled around the tin so it stuck evenly to the fat, and any excess tapped out - forming a fine layer on the fat that would seal the surface of the cake as it baked. A half-and-half mix of sifted flour and sugar was very effective, or potato starch and sugar. Then, after baking, the cakes would be left for 10 minutes before being turned out. “I know it sounds very elaborate today,” says Ivan, “but the results were often fantastic, especially if a very intricately detailed baking tin was used.”\r\n\r\nYou can still use this method today, with any fat that sets hard at room temperature, like clarified butter, lard, dripping, palm oil, coconut oil, or other vegetable fats. I prefer to use only flour as the next coating on the fat, though sugar is still useful for the inside of a soufflé dish.\r\n\r\nPros: this method allows you to use very complicated tin shapes and is easy to do with home ingredients.\r\n\r\nCons: Loads of washing up to do afterwards, and adds time to the recipe as you have to prepare the tin carefully.\r\n\r\nNon-stick sprays\r\nYou can get, in pump bottle or aerosol, a liquid that contains vegetable oil and typically an emulsifier like lecithin that forms a layer between the mixture and the tin and helps stop the cake from sticking. Really good if you’re short of time, though I have weaned myself off a dependence on them. They can leave a build-up on aluminium trays if exposed to direct heat without a covering of mixture or dough.\r\n\r\nPros: very easy and quick to use, and fairly dependable for cake mixtures.\r\n\r\nCons: A bit expensive. You’re left with a fair amount of packaging to dispose of so there are environmental concerns too.\r\n\r\nBrown, greaseproof and siliconised baking paper\r\nThough plain trays could be coated the same way, sometimes oiled paper was used for small cakes, meringues and biscuits. The big hassle in my home growing up was washing the tin with cake stuck to it, so my mum just used brown paper – this was the time when groceries were packed into brown paper bags – rubbed with sunflower oil so it turned translucent. This would be cut and folded into the tin and, even though the cake stuck to it and the paper has to be torn off, the mixture wouldn’t stick to the tin.\r\n\r\nGreaseproof or straight baking paper works the same way, and will grip onto food in fiercest way. However, if your baking paper is described as “non-stick” or has the word “siliconised” written on the box, then this usually won’t stick. It is more expensive, but it can be used at least 3-4 times before it starts to tear. Just remove the paper after baking, let it cool, the place it carefully away until next time.\r\n\r\nPros: so cheap to do so long as you collect your paper bags, or reuse your baking paper; and avoids washing up.\r\n\r\nCons: Unless the paper is coated with silicone, the food will stick to it.\r\n\r\nSilicone bakeware and sheets\r\nIn small commercial bakeries you’ll usually find a silicone baking mat lurking somewhere. Flexible and strong, reinforced with threads of fiberglass, it forms a non-stick surface that works very well with tricky high-sugar mixtures. You can bake directly on it, and it’s food safe and easy to clean. They’re expensive, but one to buy if you want a reusable long-lasting solution for flat baking sheets.\r\n\r\nLately you will have seen, or own, “tins” made entirely of silicone moulded like rubber. This should provide a complete non-stick surface but when turning out hot foods, like a molten chocolate cake, the steam can cause a suction effect and cause the mixture to stick. These moulds typically have soft rounded edges, are flexible, and lightweight but slightly unstable when filled.\r\n\r\nPros: excellent durability if looked after, light to hold and easy to clean. Provides a very good non-stick surface\r\n\r\nCons: Can be unstable when moving into or out of oven\r\n\r\nTeflon and other non-stick surfaces\r\nNearly all metal bakeware is now available with a non-stick coating. There’s a multi-billion pound coatings industry behind these quick-release surfaces and given the potential money to be made there’s competition in providing the best result.\r\n\r\nNew ceramic surfaces are starting to appear on the market, but predominantly non-stick bakeware uses one or more coats of tough fluoropolymers locked “permanently” into place through further chemical and temperature treatments.\r\n\r\nThe most well-known of these coatings is Teflon, which uses a chemical called polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to create a very low-friction surface that should, in theory, cause many food to slide right off during baking. But though Teflon has become a generic term for non-stick it should correctly be used for the type Dupont make, as there are many other types of non-stick coating, using various chemicals to achieve a similar effect: like perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP).\r\n\r\nI always end up scratching the surface in some way, don’t always clean in the corners properly, so very soon into use my food begins to stick. And when that happens I end up lining the non-stick bakeware with non-stick paper. So to be frank I’m often just as happy with the old-fashioned tins, either spankingly new or just vintage ones from car boot sales, and with paper or the butter/flour combination ensure that my cakes don’t stick. It’s what my mum did, and her mum too, and sometimes that’s reason enough.\r\n\r\n(Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/food/2012/05/stuck-on-you-a-bakerss-guide-t.shtml)", "date": "2021-08-11T10:33:18.575Z", "date_posted": "2021-08-11T10:33:18.571Z", "date_edited": "2021-08-11T10:33:18.575Z", "category": [10, 11, 12], "tag": [145]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 83, "fields": {"author": 5, "title": "Take stock", "tagline": "What’s your favourite way to make stock? And what dishes do you use it for?", "image": "stock.jpg", "image_credit": "Photo by Bluebird Provisions from Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/photo/food-healthy-wood-cup-6141484/", "content": "Tim Hayward’s programme on stock for Radio 4’s Food Programme this week extracted a wealth of information about the development of stocks and stock cubes, and piqued our interest in the subject.\r\nStock is one of those elements in cooking that is apparently simple but which takes attention and skill to make really well. Stock comes in a variety of guises, from a simple broth, to a clear-as-a-bell consommé.\r\n\r\n \r\nIt is a culinary fundamental that requires few ingredients and simple instructions – warning enough that ‘experience’ is the unnamed key ingredient. You start off with roughness; bones, carcasses, meat trimmings, crudely cut veg, a handful of herbs and you finish with complexity, savouriness, and a liquid which looks by turns silky and light-capturing. It’s cooking magic.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessional chefs take great care over their stocks and have their own preferences. Thomas Keller excludes celery from his stocks, as it adds a bitter note. As a nonpareil for decadence, Marco Pierre White ordered in crates and crates of whole chickens, destined only for stock, for his 3-starred Oak Room restaurant. In 2011’s Great British Menu, Johnny Mountain aroused the disapproval of judge Marcus Wareing over his resistance to using fish heads in his stock for a bouillabaisse, stating fish heads had no place in his cooking. Marcus didn’t agree, and Johnny’s dish, sans heads, came off the loser.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to see why the professionals take time and intense care over their stocks – they are the root of much that issues from the kitchen, most notably, stocks provide the base for sauces, the crowning glory of many dishes. The job of saucier in the kitchen is the highest in the brigade (pipped only by the sous- and head-chefs. During service, the saucier makes sure the sauces are on hand for the head-chef, ready to apply the final spoonful or drizzle to finish the dish. Stocks are the beginning of the eloquent finishing touch to the dish.\r\n\r\nWhile we’re not delivering restaurant service in our homes, there are some fundamentals that are good to know, some rules which once known, you can riff over.\r\n\r\nDos and Don'ts:\r\nThe quality points you’re looking for in a stock are:\r\n\r\n• balance of flavours\r\n• clarity\r\n• viscosity and body\r\n• good colour\r\n \r\n\r\nAll these pointers will help achieve a clear, stock with good body and colour:\r\n\r\n• Never boil a stock – you'll cloud it.\r\nA cloudy stock means that the fat, impurities and soluble proteins in the ingredients have become mixed into your stock, instead of being filtered out. The boiling action forces proteins to emulsify in the liquid, rather than coagulating gently, then either rising to the surface, where they can be skimmed, or dropping to the bottom of the pan.\r\n• Never add hot water to stock – you'll cloud it\r\nFor the same reasons as above – hot water will make the proteins in the stock set too quickly and in particles too small to be easily removed.\r\n• Don’t cover a stock while cooking.\r\nThis would increase the heat, making the stock more likely to boil. Harold McGee elaborates on the science of it: that evaporation cools the surface of the stock, making it less likely to boil, and dehydrates the soluble particles, making them more insoluble, and easier to skim off.\r\n• Always skim a stock – every 5-10 minutes for the first hour, every 30 minutes after that. Removing the impurities and scum is critical to getting good-flavoured, clear stock.\r\n• Generally speaking, don’t add salt\r\nYou don’t always know how a stock is going to be used, if the stock is reduced after being salted at the beginning, it may get too salty.\r\n• Always double strain a stock, first through a colander, then through a fine sieve\r\n• Remove as much fat as possible from the ingredients before adding to the pot\r\n• Keep it on a slow simmer – if it’s not kept hot enough, the stock can sour\r\n \r\n\r\nA stock is not a dustbin for all the manky veg and leftovers you have hanging around. To produce a good stock, you need good ingredients, but they don’t need to be premium: keep herb stalks and trimmings of meat and vegetables to make your stocks.\r\nIn brown stocks, good flavour will come from well browned meat – make sure your beef or veal bones have plenty of meat scraps on them, and that they are well roasted in pre-heated trays. Chicken wings are an excellent base for a brown chicken stock – providing heaps of flavour from a very humble joint. The cooking times will be long; 8 hours minimum for a veal or beef stock. It takes time for the flavours to marry and infuse into the liquid.\r\nFor lighter stocks, the cooking time is much shorter: fish stocks will be ready in 20 minutes, vegetable stocks in 45. The ingredients threaten to disintegrate and cloud the stock if cooked for much longer, and the flavour will suffer as a result.\r\nGelatin is an important component in stock, as it gives the liquid body. Using bones will impart gelatin to the stock, and is a key reason why bones are used, instead of just meat (aside from the cost issue). Fish stocks that use gelatinous bones from turbot and brill are considered the best.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve got your stock, the choice is yours as to its use. Glâces and demi-glâces are the first port of call when making restaurant-esque sauces. A glâce is a reduction of the stock to 10% of its original volume. The result is a deeply flavoursome liquid that is used as the base of, or mixed into, other flavours to make sauces. A demi-glâce is a stock reduced to 25-40% of its original volume and is used widely in professional kitchens.\r\n\r\nSo rather than simply boiling up an old roast chicken carcass, give a little more time and devotion to your stocks. Your risotto (and soups, gravies, pies, stews) will thank you for it. And your sauces will be out of this world.\r\n\r\n(Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/food/2012/03/take-stock.shtml)", "date": "2021-08-11T10:40:24.443Z", "date_posted": "2021-08-11T10:40:24.439Z", "date_edited": "2021-08-11T10:40:24.444Z", "category": [6, 9, 11, 12], "tag": [13, 5, 146]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 84, "fields": {"author": 5, "title": "Can I make cheese at home?", "tagline": "Have you tried making cheese - what were your findings?

A product that is essentially formed from curdled milk – usually poured down the drain with disgust – and then injected or smeared with bacteria and mould, left for months at a time, in a cave… You’ve got to admit that cheese-phobes have a fair point. But along with bakers and chocolatiers, cheese makers are the alchemists of food production.\r\n\r\nSo where did it come from? The earliest remains of cheese were found in an Egyptian pot in the stepped pyramid of Saqqara dating from 2300BC, making it among the oldest known food products. Through what must have been phenomenal trial and error, the earliest cheesemakers would make a brine solution to extract the enzymes from the stomach lining of milk-fed calves to make a cheese somewhat like feta. \r\n \r\nBut you can make your own cheese in as little as twenty minutes at home with just a few ingredients. A fresh cheese, made without rennet, can be brought to life using a little yoghurt as a bacterial starter and vinegar as an acid.  These form curds in the milk which can be scooped out and drained through a muslin cloth held in a sieve. The length of draining time will determine how crumbly or firm the cheese is.  You can also play with the fat content of your milk – adding cream if you want a more spreadable version. Or press it further to make a sliceable, fryable paneer.\r\n\r\nIt’s crumbly and tangy and the smell as you make it is amazing – it’s like the smell of a baby’s head filling your kitchen. This cheese won’t melt like a rennet-curdled cheese – the protein structure is too fragile. But on top of a pizza (possibly mixed with chopped, wilted spinach), as part of a lasagne, drizzled with honey and served with soft fruits, your own homemade cheese lets you be a dairy alchemist for a half an hour.\r\n\r\nWhat is vegetarian rennet?\r\nSince the 1980s, biotechnologists have created a rennet substitute from bacteria, yeasts or fungi that synthesise chymosin – the enzyme that causes curdling - these have been used to meet the huge demand for cheese and to provide a vegetarian alternative to animal-derived rennet.  However, plant-derived rennet is not a new invention to meet a modern demand. Wild cardoon flowers were used by sheep and goat farmers to form curds in cheeses such as Serra and Torta del Casar. The thistle flowers contain a close biochemical relative of the chymosin.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the holes in Swiss cheese?\r\nThe same bacteria that causes spots makes the holes in Swiss cheese. Well, the same species, anyway. Propionibacteria forms part of the Swiss starter culture that feeds on lactic acid during the ripening phase and converts it to other acids and carbon dioxide. These gas bubbles form holes in the cheese as it ripens at a warm temperature for a few weeks. Propionibacteria acnes, its rather less popular cousin, inhabits human skin and particularly, blocked oil glands.\r\n\r\nWhy does cheese sometimes crunch?\r\nCheese crystals – the little salty crunch you sometimes feel in a piece of aged gruyère, parmesan or cheddar – are calcium lactate salts form during the ripening of the cheese, rather than the salt added by the cheesemaker.  Pecorino, feta and roquefort are the saltiest, containing about 5% salt content.\r\n\r\nWhat’s American process cheese?\r\nProcessed or ‘process’ cheese is very popular in America. It pops up here in fast food outlets and in ready-wrapped slices. This cheese is made by melting together the scraps and unripened cast-offs of industrial cheese production. Phosphates and acids are added to transform this into a homogenous mass which can be molded, cooled and sliced. These cheeses melt very well, but have a lower calcium content for it.\r\n\r\nDoes cheese clean your teeth?\r\nResearch published in 2007 showed that caseinophosphopeptides contained in cheese (and other dairy products) do help dental enamel recalcify – or harden up- after eating. As opposed to brushing your teeth directly after eating, which can brush away small bits of softened enamel from the tooth. So cheese doesn’t clean your teeth, but it can help them stay strong.\r\n\r\nBonus factoid: Cheese is the most shoplifted item in the world.\r\n\r\n(Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/food/2012/03/can-i-make-cheese-at-home.shtml)", "date": "2021-08-11T10:45:26.917Z", "date_posted": "2021-08-11T10:45:26.914Z", "date_edited": "2021-08-11T10:45:26.918Z", "category": [9], "tag": [147]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 85, "fields": {"author": 5, "title": "How sustainable food improves school performance", "tagline": "What do you think of the Food for Life approach?

As a parent of a child just starting school, I was delighted that the Food for Life Partnership  won the Derek Cooper award - for the individual or organisation doing most to bring about real change in our relationship with food.  Kevin Morgan, professor of governance and development at Cardiff University, who nominated the programme described it: \"The most ambitious programme in the UK to date ...which champions a whole-school approach and is working with over 4,200 schools in England to enable children to eat good food, learn where it comes from, how it is produced and how to grow it and cook it themselves.\"\r\n\r\nSo how has teaching children about sustainable, local and organic food in this way helped address growing health and social issues and the rising cost of food?  And is it promising a food culture we can’t afford?\r\n\r\nThe campaign’s goals are clear: “Getting schools involved in cooking and growing activities, visiting farms and serving healthy school meals.” There is a clear set of criteria for school meals to meet if they are to be awarded accredited status – they must be freshly prepared and locally sourced. Surprisingly, there are no additional nutrition-based criteria for schools to meet when they enrol in the programme. However, the quality of the food and the eating experience (insisting on plates, rather than plastic trays) seems to raise expectations and standards that translate into healthier eating.\r\n\r\nIf the food must be local and seasonal, it follows that it will be varied and fresh. If the meat must be Freedom Food certified or free-range, e.g. more expensive, there will probably be less meat and more vegetables served.  And through farm visits and exposure to fruits and vegetables in the garden -  away from the dinner table battleground – uptake of fruit and vegetables is on the rise, with the number of kids eating their five-a-day up 28%. Cooking skills is another key part of the programme – getting kids skilled up to make use of the fresh food coming in.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of its success is breathtaking. The National Foundation for Educational Research’s independent evaluation of the scheme found that, “As a result of FFLP, interviewees reported that the improved quality of meals, increased school meal uptake and improvements to the social cohesion at school had contributed to improvements in pupils’ attainment and behaviour.”  Twice as many primary schools have an Ofsted ‘outstanding’ rating after they have joined the scheme. Money is being generated for the local economy, instead of disappearing into multi-national food business.\r\n\r\nBut as always cost is still an major issue. The price, availability and sourcing of both local and organic produce was mentioned by many catering staff and programme coordinators as major challenges. And extra funding was required by almost all participating schools to make the programme work – money that will increasingly be difficult to secure. The lottery funding for the entire programme - £16.9m over its first five years - is finishing at the end of this year.\r\n\r\nThe current government is unlikely to come up with the money for such a hands-on project. From the re-focussing of the Food Standards Agency in 2010, removing any food labelling or nutritional guidance remit, to this week’s quiet disbanding of the advisory group set up to tackle the obesity crisis, it has put its faith in a self-regulating industry to nudge people to make healthier choices of food. Its own similarly titled Change4Life campaign budget has been slashed for 2011/12, but still receives £8.5m annually. Means employed have included vouchers for fruit and veg in ASDA, television ads telling people to eat smaller portions, and something called a ‘fun generator’.\r\n\r\nWill this approach be as effective? Too early to say here in the UK but across the pond the US government has caused controversy among nutritionists and real food campaigners by bowing to pressure from processed food industry lobbyists, namely The American Frozen Food Institute. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act passed on Tuesday blocks reforms to school meals that would have discounted the minimal amount of tomato puree found on a pizza as a vegetable. Yes, you heard. Pizza is a vegetable.\r\n\r\nWhile it appears that Food for Life has been very successful, it’s facing a tough future.  It’s advocating everything the government is cutting. And the perceived effort and cost is daunting to schools under pressure. But the alternative may prove more costly in the long run.\r\n\r\n(Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/food/2011/11/sustainable-food-improves-scho.shtml)", "date": "2021-08-11T10:53:02.980Z", "date_posted": "2021-08-11T10:53:02.975Z", "date_edited": "2021-08-11T10:53:02.981Z", "category": [11], "tag": [71, 148]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 86, "fields": {"author": 5, "title": "Five essentials for the best homemade pizza", "tagline": "Have you successfully made pizza at home?

Adam Kuban, the founder and top dog editor, and publisher Ed Levine are obsessive about their pizzas and if it doesn’t get you revved up and into pizza mania then nothing will.\r\n\r\nPizza geekiness aside, you can turn out excellent pizza at home so long as you have these five essentials:\r\n\r\n1. A really hot oven or grill\r\n\r\nYou ideally want an oven that will go to at least 240C/475F. The oven needs to have good even heat and the best way to check that is by baking a loaf of bread on a tray and once it’s cool check the base - if it’s much paler than the top then your oven needs help. A heavy pizza stone or a metal griddle placed in the cold oven and heated will help stop your pizzas looking flabby.\r\n\r\nBut if you don’t have a hot enough oven but do have a grill then Heston demonstrates a brilliant way that combines the hob and the grill for a perfect pizza from his In Search of Perfection BBC series.\r\n\r\n2. Soft white bread dough\r\n\r\nEssentially pizza is made with a simple flour, salt and yeast dough mixed with enough water to make it very soft and stretchy. And for a very basic pizza dough, a recipe like this from Antony Worrall Thompson will be fine. But of course, if you’re after pizza perfection you’ll want to personalise the ingredients and the method. As Ed says on Slice, “we should celebrate and praise crust diversity in pizza, not bury it.”\r\n\r\nFlour: Though an Italian 00 flour is essential if you want to replicate the traditional pizza from Naples, and that’s my preference, many prefer a strong bread flour as it can be coaxed out extra thin without too much worry. My choice for an excellent strong flour recipe would be J. Kenji Lopez-Alt’s “New York Style Pizza at Home”.\r\n\r\nFat, sugar and malt: Fat, whether you use lard or oil, slightly interferes with the formation of gluten in the dough, and that means a more tender crust less likely to turn brittle in the dry oven. It also helps the dough to colour quickly, as does a little sugar or malt. Pizza makers in Italy often use special flours that have an elevated natural maltose level, which means that they don’t have to add any extra to the flour. But at home, a little sugar, honey or malt (even a dark beer will do) will help your dough to colour quickly and stray crisp but moist and tender.\r\n\r\n3. Stretch it in stages\r\n\r\nOne secret to getting a thin crust pizza is to divide the dough into portions (the site pizzamaking.com has a terrific online calculators for making the right amount of dough), say 200g/7oz dough for each 25cm/10in thin crust pizza. Shape these portions into rounds, place on a dusted worktop, cover with a cloth and leave for 15 minutes. This will make the dough relax, and then it will be much easier to stretch into perfect pizza rounds.\r\n\r\n4. Dry your topping first\r\n\r\nWhen most ingredients are heated they change in some way. The sauce, cheese, vegetables and cured meats soften and release liquid or fat, turning a delicious mass into an oily pizza pond. To avoid this, dry wet cheese like mozzarella out on a cloth, cook the sauce until it is thick and spreadable but not runny, and allow for the fat released from meats etc before adding any extra oil.\r\n\r\n5. Go light on the topping\r\n\r\nLess topping makes a better pizza. Memorise that phrase and you’ll make better, crisper pizzas. Ideally your pizza should have a thin ring of crust and be completely cooked through. Too much sauce, cheese and other bits will cause the topping run over the crust, stop heat from penetrating, lower the tray or stone temperature, and generally ruin what might have been excellent pizza.\r\n\r\n(Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/food/2011/09/five-essentials-for-the-best-h-1.shtml)", "date": "2021-08-11T11:03:20.451Z", "date_posted": "2021-08-11T11:03:20.445Z", "date_edited": "2021-08-11T11:03:20.452Z", "category": [2, 4, 9, 12], "tag": [149]}}, {"model": "recipes.category", "pk": 1, "fields": {"name": "asian", "friendly_name": "Asian", "sku": "ra1"}}, {"model": "recipes.category", "pk": 2, "fields": {"name": "european", "friendly_name": "European", "sku": "ra2"}}, {"model": "recipes.category", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "maghreb_african", "friendly_name": "Maghreb & African", "sku": "ra3"}}, {"model": "recipes.category", "pk": 4, "fields": {"name": "north_american", "friendly_name": "North American", "sku": "ra4"}}, {"model": "recipes.category", "pk": 5, "fields": {"name": "south_american", "friendly_name": "South American", "sku": "ra5"}}, {"model": "recipes.category", "pk": 6, "fields": {"name": "vegetarian", "friendly_name": "Vegetarian", "sku": "rb1"}}, {"model": "recipes.category", "pk": 7, "fields": {"name": "vegan", "friendly_name": "Vegan", "sku": "rb2"}}, {"model": "recipes.category", "pk": 8, "fields": {"name": "gluten_free", "friendly_name": "Gluten Free", "sku": "rb3"}}, {"model": "recipes.category", "pk": 9, "fields": {"name": "unrestricted", "friendly_name": "Unrestricted", "sku": "rb4"}}, {"model": "recipes.category", "pk": 10, "fields": {"name": "breakfast", "friendly_name": "Breakfast", "sku": "rc1"}}, {"model": "recipes.category", "pk": 11, "fields": {"name": "lunch", "friendly_name": "Lunch", "sku": "rc2"}}, {"model": "recipes.category", "pk": 12, "fields": {"name": "dinner", "friendly_name": "Dinner", "sku": "rc3"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 1, "fields": {"tagname": "american"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 2, "fields": {"tagname": "asian"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 3, "fields": {"tagname": "australian"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 4, "fields": {"tagname": "beef"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 5, "fields": {"tagname": "caribbean"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 6, "fields": {"tagname": "chicken"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 7, "fields": {"tagname": "chinese"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 8, "fields": {"tagname": "english"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 9, "fields": {"tagname": "filipino"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 10, "fields": {"tagname": "fish"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 11, "fields": {"tagname": "indian"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 12, "fields": {"tagname": "japanese"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 13, "fields": {"tagname": "mediterannean"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 14, "fields": {"tagname": "mexican"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 15, "fields": {"tagname": "moroccan"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 17, "fields": {"tagname": "pork"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 19, "fields": {"tagname": "spinach"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 20, "fields": {"tagname": "tunisian"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 23, "fields": {"tagname": "french"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 32, "fields": {"tagname": "african"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 43, "fields": {"tagname": "niçoise"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 44, "fields": {"tagname": "burger"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 45, "fields": {"tagname": "pasta"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 46, "fields": {"tagname": "tacos"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 47, "fields": {"tagname": "duck"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 48, "fields": {"tagname": "soup"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 49, "fields": {"tagname": "steak"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 50, "fields": {"tagname": "provençal"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 51, "fields": {"tagname": "pizza"}}, {"model": "recipes.tag", "pk": 52, "fields": {"tagname": "curry"}}, {"model": "recipes.recipe", "pk": 49, "fields": {"author": 5, "title": "Salade Niçoise", "intro": "The original, as described by Jaques Médecin, former Mayor of Nice!", "prep_time": "30min", "cook_time": "", "total_time": "30mins", "servings": 6, "directions": "Quarter and liberally salt the tomatoes.
